# trip-list-project

Hello, my name is Israel Franco, and I am a student here at Dev Mountain. My idea for this project was to make an app that allows the user to keep track of the trips that they want to go on, or trips that they have already gone on. My idea is to make two different lists that allow the user to input their data and add it the list desired. The reason why I chose this is because personally, I enjoy traveling and exploring other places around the world. Therefore, being able to track all the places I have been already, as well as being able to track the places I would want to go in the future.
